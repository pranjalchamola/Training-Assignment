                                    History
                                    The US-based serial entrepreneurs Niranjan Chintam and Krishna Chintam took over city-based VMF Soft Tech Ltd. in 2009 and renamed it to Kellton Tech.[5] Kellton Tech has, since then, expanded their business portfolio following an organic and inorganic path by making acquisitions in the US and India.[6] 
                                    Services
                                    The company provides Digital Transformation, Digital Connected Enterprise, SAP, Outsourced Product Development, and Digital Commerce and Marketing.[7] 
                                    Kellton Tech developed mSehat, a State Innovations in Family Planning Services Agency (SIFPSA) project to help health workers in five districts of Uttar Pradesh to record maternal-infant data in real time and provide them healthcare services. [8] mSehat was featured as a Case Study in a World Health Organization (WHO) report.[9] The report observed that mSehat is "currently the largest mHealth implementation in the world in terms of population served".[10] 
                                    Locations
                                    Through expansion and acquired companies it has offices in Hyderabad, Gurgaon, Lucknow and United States. It established an office in Ireland.[11]
